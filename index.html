    <u><b>WHAT I HAVE LEARNED THUS FAR</b></u>
<br> 
<br> I have always wondered how the internet works behind the scenes. How is it possible to simply type in a word or question, and my answer magically appear on my computer screen?
<br>
<br>Well there is definitely a process behind it. I simply type in a question or word into my browser, which is sent to the internet, and then to the servers via HTTP. The server will then send over a file, which is magically displayed on my computer screen.

  
  
  
</P>The <b>World Wide Web </b> is comprised of a collection of documents called Hyper Text Markup Launguage, or  <b>HTML</b> for short. 
Without these documents, the web would be non existent. These documents are made up of what you visually see (text content), how things are arranged (markup), and also links to other pages.
<br>
<br>HTML also have <em>tags</em>, which is what sentences are made out of. In each sentence, there is an opening tag, the actual content, and a closing tag. Some cool tags that I am learning are <b>bold</b>,<em> emphasis (or italic)</em> and <u>underline</u> to name a few.

<br> I also learned how to create a link to a page, take a look <a href= "www.udacity.com">here</a>.
<br>
<br>Whitespace is what we use to create a new line. It can be either inline or block tags. Inline is a void tag and does not need a closing tag, it is simply meant to end a line. Block tags make invisible boxes, which allow the width and size of the text to vary.
